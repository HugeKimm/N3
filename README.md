## ðŸ“œIntroduction

"In this project, I used GSAP and JavaScript to create a dynamic and visually appealing landing page. 
The animations, powered by GSAP, add smooth transitions and interactions, enhancing the user experience and making the website more engaging. 
Each element, from the text to the images, is animated to capture attention and provide a modern, sleek feel to the landing page."
